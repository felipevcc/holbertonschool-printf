.SH NAME
printf - format and print data

.SH SYNOPSIS
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

This project is a simulation of the printf function in C with its most important features, it was made in the software development program of Holberton School.
Its functionality is to print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT.

.SH OPTIONS

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.  The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.B d, i 
.RS
The  int  argument  is  converted to signed decimal notation and prints this.

.RE 
.B o, u, x, X
.RS
The  unsigned  int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation, "x" is to lowercase and "X" is to uppercase.

.RE 
.B b
.RS
Prints a converted number to binary (base 2).

.RE
.B c
.RS
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is  written. 

.RE
.B s
.RS
Prints a string assign it in parameter's position. If string does not exist prints "(null)" in the same position.

.RE
.B p
.RS
The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (0x + %lx), prints an address.

.RE
.B r 
.RS
Prints a reversed string.

.RE
.B R
.RS
Converts a string to rot13 and prints this.

.RE
.B %
.RS
A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.SH RETURN VALUE

Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null  byte  used  to  end  output  to strings). 

.SH EXAMPLES

To call the _printf() function the next code is required:

#include "main.h"

int main() 
.TP
\r{
.TP
	_printf("string to print");
.TP
	return (0);
.TP
\r}

.TP
Here's an example of how does the parameters work in our _printf() function:
.TP
#include "main.h"
.TP
int main()
.TP
\r{
.TP
	_printf("Cohort: %i", 19);
.TP
	return (0);
.TP
\r}
.TP
The output of this main function will be:
.TP
Cohort: 19
